## About Me ℹ️ 🌟
I’m Kamia, a Data Scientist specializing in predictive analytics, including time series analysis. With a background in Biology and Chemistry, I work as a freelancer, offering data science and machine learning solutions to clients in environmental science and biotech.

I have over 8 years of experience working in various industries, where I excelled in strategy and communications. In my current role as a Data Scientist, I have developed creative predictive machine learning solutions in areas such as surf forecasting, urban agriculture, and biochemistry. Additionally, I have a strong foundation in natural language processing (NLP) and am passionate about expanding my expertise in this area.

I excel at leveraging advanced analytics and machine learning to uncover insights and solve complex problems. My expertise has been recognized through certifications, including BrainStation in Data Science and Omdena as a Machine Learning Engineer.

I believe in the power of data to drive innovation and create meaningful change. My approach is fueled by curiosity and a commitment to continuous learning, which fosters growth and leads to creative, yet technically sound solutions. I combine a deep understanding of both the technical and commercial aspects of data science with a strong desire to create strategic, positive impact.

In my free time, I enjoy surfing, exploring surf history and art, practicing yoga, and expanding my knowledge in various areas of tech. I'm also passionate about staying up-to-date with emerging technology trends.
