### Hi there, I'm Kamia 👋 😊 

## About Me ℹ️ 🌟
I am a hospitality worker turned Data Scientist. I have a backgroud in Biology and Chemistry and have a strong passion for analytics and 
experiment design. I also have a strong interest in people and communication. I have always been interested in uncovering patterns and understanding
systems and I am a highly curious individual. My curiosity has led me to pursue different career paths but when I found Data Science I knew I was in love!
Working in a lab for four years, I have always enjoyed getting my hands dirty and directly applying concepts as I learned them. What was the most rewarding
for me was the analysis and storytelling I got to do with the resutls of my experiments. When I discovered Data Science a whole other world was unlocked 
for me, a world where I get to follow my curiosity and interest in hands on experiementation and my passion for in depth analysis! Data Science allows 
me to apply my creative problem solving skills to many different areas and the possibilites really are endless! Currently I am very interested in 
Time Series and NLP and the diverse applications of these two areas of Data Science. 💡🚀
